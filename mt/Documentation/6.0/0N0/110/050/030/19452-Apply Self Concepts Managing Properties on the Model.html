        <p class="p">You may have noticed when you were creating your tables and columns, that the properties dialog box for every business object has two additional lists to the right of the <strong class="ph b">Subject</strong>  list. These lists are related to
          <strong
          class="ph b">concept editing</strong> . The two additional lists are the <strong class="ph b">Properties</strong>  list, and the <strong class="ph b">Property Editor</strong>  (Settings), and they operate in the same way regardless of the object to which you
            are applying metadata. </p>
